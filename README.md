# Project Objective
Our goal is to develop an optimized routing solution for a brewery’s delivery trucks by analyzing logistical data related to freight, factories, transported volumes, and load capacities. The proposal aims to identify more efficient opportunities that reduce operational costs, increase fleet utilization, and ensure proper demand fulfillment, contributing to the optimization of the company's logistical planning.

# Estrategic
At our company, we combine technology, data analysis, and creativity to develop personalized solutions that optimize time, reduce costs, and drive results. Our strategy is centered on a deep understanding of each client’s needs, applying market intelligence and digital tools to turn challenges into opportunities.

# Colab and Language R
For the implementation of the codes developed in the project, we used Google Colab, which allows for practical and efficient data manipulation and analysis. The tool is widely used in data science and machine learning, offering cloud-based computing resources. All the developed structures and their explanations are provided below.

> Data analysis and processing
In the initial phase, we performed the main analyses, such as mapping clients and factories, resolving errors found in the dataset, and ensuring the data was clean and structured for the next steps of the project.

> Efficiency of factories and clients
The efficiency was evaluated based on the freight cost and the quantity transported, following the logic that the higher the freight cost, the greater the quantity that should be transported. The code was developed using the DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) method, and to run it, the attached spreadsheet must be used.

> Cost optimization
For the optimization, we used the factories' capacity, customer demand, and the average unit cost of each route. The goal was to optimize the 2023 freight cost, which amounted to R$25,477,365.12.
